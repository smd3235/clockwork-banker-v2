## What is this thing?

Ever wondered what would happen if a Swiss watch had a baby with a bank vault? Well, wonder no more! Clockwork Banker is here to manage your gear needs with the precision of a metronome and the reliability of that one friend who always pays you back (we all have one, right?).

## Features

- ⏰ **Precise Timing**: Because Seru doesn't sleep, and neither do we (send help)
- 🤖 **Automated Everything**: Let the bot (really us) handle your request while you handle more important things, like arguing with strangers on Discord
- 🔒 **Security**: More secure than your grandmother's secret cookie recipe
- 💸 **Money Management**: We'll help you budget so well, you'll actually have money left over for avocado toast - oh wait....wrong type of Banker

## Warning ⚠️

This software may cause:
- Sudden urges to check for upgrades every 5 minutes
- Compulsive alting (is that a word?)
- Uncontrollable excitement when finding the right piece of gear for your alt!

## FAQ

**Q: Is this better than my current farming method of "hope and pray"?**
- A: Significantly.

**Q: What if I find a bug?**
- A: Congratulations! You've discovered a "surprise feature." Please report it so we can pretend it was intentional.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add a feature? Pull requests welcome! Just remember:
- Code like your future self is going to maintain it (and they know where you live)
- Comments are like deodorant - you might not think you need them, but everyone around you disagrees
- If it works, don't touch it. If it doesn't work, blame the previous developer (even if that was you)
